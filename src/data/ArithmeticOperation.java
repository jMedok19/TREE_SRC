/**
 * This class represents all arithmetic operations including Addition,
 * Subtraction and Multiplication. All these operations need two operands
 * (sub-trees) to process the calculation.
 * 
 * The class uses Template Method design pattern. The common part (left operand
 * and right operand) is defined in this class and is shared in the sub-classes.
 * 
 * No default toString() defined.
